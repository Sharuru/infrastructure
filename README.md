# infrastructure

Implementing infrastructure as code.

- backup.sh: used to backup docker volumes in the past.
- deploy-rest-batch-pipe.groovy: jenkins script, used to deploy Spring Batch to specific servers in the past.
- fake-backup.sh: fake backup job, called by cron to bypass the useless PMO security check :P
